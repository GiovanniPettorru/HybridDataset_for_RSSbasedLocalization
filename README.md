# RSS Dataset for Outdoor Localization Algorithms
This dataset is a complete set of RSS reads collected by a Target Raspberry Pi 4 model B node using an external WiFi interface that is intended to capture probe requests sent by anchor nodes Raspberry Pi Zero W located in the scenario.
For conducting the tests, a scenario was created in the outdoor parking lots of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Cagliari. Six anchor nodes were used distributed along a rectangle of size 21.1 x 30 meters as shown in the figure.

The purpose of this dataset is to provide real RSS measurements, thus affected by propagation disturbances such as typical of these scenarios, by means of which to be able to test RSS-based localization algorithms.
