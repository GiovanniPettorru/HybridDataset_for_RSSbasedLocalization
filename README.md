# RSSDataset_outdoorLocalization
This dataset is a complete set of RSS readings collected by a Target Raspberry Pi 4 model B node using an external WiFi interface.
For conducting the tests, a scenario was created in the outdoor parking lots of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Cagliari. Six anchor nodes were used distributed along a rectangle of size 21.1 x 30 meters as shown in the figure.
